Requirements:
Design a parking lot that allows drivers to

1) Enter the lot and get an assigned spot.
2) Exit the lot and your spot becomes available.
3) View how many available spots are there.


Obvious requirements not explicitly mentioned:
1) If no available spots on entry, show capacity exceeded msg
2) If vehicle number not in lot, show vehicle not found error - highly unlikely in real world
